File 2 is an amazing file, filled with mystery and intruigeueiueieu..
I can't spell. This is a grand tradgedy.
I really can't spell, can I?
What a shame.
Where's the mystery, you ask? I don't know, but I'll continue typing regardless.
The goal is to write enough so that the file is more than 512 bytes, or 0x200 in hex.
this is greater than the size of a sector, which for this partition means that the file is composed
of several fat clusters. Being able to read the entirity of this file shows that the code to read a
file from the partition is at least somewhat functional, and able to read multiple
clusters. hopefully, it works. I mean, as I'm writing this we're definitely a ways away yet. We've
got to detect the fat partition first, before we can even find a file.
eventually, I might be able to execute code present on a file... maybe even C code?
that'd be nice. some nice 32 bit C, much better than 16 bit assembly...
